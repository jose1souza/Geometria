# Geometry Project

This algorithm is an implementation of *geometric shapes* that can perform operations such as:
- *Calculating their area*
- *Drawing their geometric shape*

## How It Works

1. The algorithm creates shapes through Java classes.
2. The user defines the dimensions depending on the shape.
3. The algorithm calculates its area and draws it using '*'.
